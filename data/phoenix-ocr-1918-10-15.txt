A BOND FOR EVERY STUDENT THE PHOENIX Vol. XXXVUI SWARTHMORE COLLEGE, TENTH MONTH 15. 1918 No. 5. "CARRY ON'" THE LOAN! The Fourth Liberty Loan ends Satlrday!Already Swarthmore has subscribed ipproximately $23,100. S. A. T. C $BOOO Company C 4500 Company D 3500 Women students .*. 6000 Colored help 600 -rum Creek Navy 350 Faculty 3650 Has every Swarthmorean subscribed until it hurts? Remember, you are not giving your money, but lending it to your government at the splendid nterest of 4 1-4 per cent. Every member of the colored help of Swarthmore College who was approached gave willingly. Shall we, the members of the S. A. T. C, receiving i free college education from the government, besides a regular private's pay; shall we, the women students of the college, whose only way of showing that our hearts are in it is by giving our time and money; shall we, the student body as a whole, be taught the enthusiasm of true Americanism by the colored help of the college? Remember our slogan: "A Liberty Bond for every student!" - MARTIAL LAW SUBDUES WHARTONITESNo more does the peaceful Whartonite pursue a free and easy life and nmble over the campus or thru the village at his own sweet will. No more loes he revel in a large and luxurious room and enjoy the strains of his neighbor's victrola during study hour. And as for the amount of drilling and bayonet practice that goes on! Ask the fair inhabitants of Section F. They know. A system of sentry duty has been I'Stablished in Wharton barracks that bids fair to revolutionize the old habits of the inmates. The sentry answers the phone, he inspects rooms and sees that the fellows are studying when they should, he questions each man leaving the barracks during the study time to make sure that his reason is a good CDneA The time is yet to come when visitors coming up the asphaltum or "cementum" are challenged by "who soes there?" and a loaded gun, but the barrack sentry offers a very fair substitute for this and is much less likely to intimidate peaceful citizens. A new reform is going thru as this is being written. Officers are scurrying to and fro armed with large blueprints of Wharton plans and coils of metal tape line measuring the rooms so that the men may be quartered according to government specification, with an allowance of forty-five square feet of floor space and and 1,000 cubic feet of air per man. This is destined to play havoc with the present arrangements which fof the most part are overgenerous. Also, rumor has it that the men are to be quartered by squads and many old and long cherished combinations -may be broken up. Sunday morning inspection of rooms is another thing that is new. To see the great bustle and the frantic wielding of mops and dusters that goes on just before inspection one might think that he chanced upon a school of domestic science. It is an entertaining Sunday morning occupation to watch inspection from Section F. There is an attitude of strained expectancy on the part of those last inspected, a furtive examination from time to time to make sure that everything is in the pmk of condition. We even saw one freshman who had been standing painfully at attention for five minutes waiting his turn to be inspected, take out a clean handkerchief and dust the window sill because a train had just passed. ALBERT N. NELSON DIES OF PNEUMONIA AT CAMP TAYLOR Albertson Healthy In German Camp—Stow Obtains Furlough to Return to College On Sunday noon, Dean Alexander received a telegram from Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky, notifying him of the death of his nephew, Albert N. Nelson. "Al'\ as he was popularly known around college, was taken sick with Spanich influenza, which developed into pneumonia. However, he  ered the effects of this and seemed to be convalescing. The last word which the Dean received prior to the telegram was from the Y. M. C. A. secretary to the effect that Al. was getting better. So that the telegram on Sunday was a serious shock to his friends and relatives. Nelson was one of the bigjest men in his class, 1919, and had he returned to college this year, he would have been one of the leaders of the student body. He was president of the Young Men's Christian Association, and associate editor of the Phoenix; a member of the Halcyon staff, and a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Nelson enlisted i" the Field Artillery in the latter part t .Anerust and was able to enter the officers' training camp. A letter from him at that time tendering his resignation to the Phoenix staff reads: "It is with much regret that I leave the work on the good old sheet, but this is the time of many sacrifices, and I hone I can be of some service to Uncle Sam in his great undertaking."Probably the thiner which everyone at college most admired in Al., was his nerve and grit in coming to college with absolutely no financial assistance. In comparison with the other men. he received practicallv no scholarship. He served as a waiter in the dining-room, and later as doorkeeper. At midnight or early in the morning it was a common thing to see Al. come in from observatory where he had been helping with the telescope. However, in -spite of this constant drain on his time and his strength, his studies were perfectly prepared. Moreover, he was never too busy to take part in the activities which surrounded the college before the war, or to do something for some oae else. Above everything else he was unselfish. Albert N. ISeU.ni, *l9 HOW VISNISKKI EDITS THE STARS AND STRIPES FOR PERSHING'S MEN Swarthmore Man and Founder of the Stars and Stripes Given Rank of Captain By Richard Spillane You've all heard of the Stars and Stripes, and probably all of you have heard of Guy T. Visniskki, Swarthmore, ex-'9B, its founder and editor. Here's an appreciative sketch of his work from Commerce and Finance. You can address "Visk": Stars and Stripes, G 2, A. E. F., 1 Rue des Italiennes, Paris. He was born in Carmi, 111., 40-odd yoars ago. His father was a soldier in the Civil War. With our entrance into the war this man of 40-odd asked himself the question, "What is my duty?" He was not robust. He was not rich. He was married. He had three children, nearly all young. Nearly all his life he had worked indoors, writing, planning, directinb the energies of others. There were many reasons why he should leave to others the work of war. There was one why he should not; for in the long ago one of his forbears had sought asylum here from a land oppressed. The man of 40 closed his desk, put his house in order and went to the omcers' training camp at Fort Myer. There he studied, there he drilled. At the end of three months he got a commission as second lieutenant, was assigned to a company and sent to Fort Lee, at Petersburg, Va. The work of a second lieutenant with a lot of raw recruits to handle is enough to keep any ordinary man busy, but this frail man of 40-odd wanted to do more. One day went to the commandant of the camp and made a suggestion."Good," said the commandant. "Go to it." The man of 40-odd got le.ave to make a trip to Richmond. There he conferred with Colonel Hasbrook, of the Times-Dispatch. "I want you to print a newspaper for me," he said. "I want you to furnish paper, look after the composition, take care of all the mechanical end. I want it regular newspaper size. I want, too, an illustrated section with a good grade of paper. I'll look after the editorial end, see that 'copy' is here in good time, that pictures for cuts are here promptly; that you are relieved of every detail but that of printing the paper. What will it cost?" "Not one cent more than the bare cost to the Times-Dispatch for material and labor," was the reply. "Good," said the man of 40-odd. Then the second lieutenant went forth to visit the merchants of Richmond and other places. He had a "dummy" of his paper. ' "I'll be glad to advertise," said a merchant. "I'll take two inches of space."  "No,". said the second lieutenant. "That never will do. What you want in this paper if you want any space at all is a quarter page." The man of 40-odd got a contract for a quarter page. He got lots of quarter-page and column and halfcolumn ads. Then he got a soldier who had been circulation manager of a Pittsburgh dally and put him at work getting subscriptions to his paper that was to be. Meanwhile he wrote and had others write. He had colonels, majors, cap- SWARTHMORE UNIT OF S. A. T. C.

IF every black cloud had a cyclone in it the world would have been blown to toothpicks long ago" says Billy Sunday. If Billy were here at present he might add that if we took the advice of every quarantine knocker, the faculty Would be out of a job, the health authorities would be in the hospital and Wharton Hall would be for rent. For the benefit of the man who can see only rheumatism in the rainbow, may we point out that the black cloud is not full of cyclones, but of silver linings. So before you join the anvil chorus, take a personal inventory and compare your life at Swarthmore with the daily habitat of the army camp rookie. If you find it inconvenient to send a kid down to the Pie Shop, how would you like to hike two dusty miles for a piece of pie, as Lieutenant Klauder, ex.-'2O, writes of doing at Camp Grant? If six hours drill a week knocks you out, what would the regular six hours a day in the army camp do to you? If slinging soup on Kitchen Police goes against your grain, remember that in the regular army you not only have to sling soup but make it first. If you crab because you haven't got a gun, how much more will you crab when you have to clean that gun and carry it? If you don't like to make your bed, thank your luck that you have a bed to make; you won't have one very long. If you object to changing your room, be thankful you have a room instead of one bunk in a tier, a hundred bunks to the room. If you don't like to take a chance on a new roommate, how would you like to be thrown in with a couple hundred new drafted men from every back alley of life? If you don't like the grub this year, thank your lucky stars you weren't here last year. If 6.10 in the morning seems a trifle early for a pirouette from the husks just be glad your bugler doesn't suffer from insomnia and sound reveille at 5,30 as in most camps. If sitting down at a table during guard duty is irksome, cheer up, you'll soon be packing a musket four hours off, four hours on during a cold night. If If this climate is too damp you'll find the cantdfiments, according to Lieutenant Simpson, ex.-'l 9, "so dusty you can't see the man forty inches in front of you." . If you think Swarthmore is being modeled into a second P. M. C, remember that while other colleges have been handicapped by late starts and have marked time with uniform measuring-, physical exams, and red tape, Swarthmore has made such rapid strides that when the* men marched in review on October 1, Colonel Reynolds exclaimed, "If they had uniforms, thy'd be real soldiers." In other words, before you raise your little hammer "agin the government," just remember that the pasture nearest to you is always greener than your own. As Ensigih Tisdale, ex.-'l 5, writes, "In all branches of the service now, everybody wants to be where he isn't. In what idea lsurroundings we wrap-the other follow's job." THE OTHER SIDE To the Editor of The Phoenix: October 5, 1918. I have observed that in the three issues of The Phoenix published so far this autumn in nearly every column there is some kind of glorification of the military training adopted in the college, and I have been pained to observe that in the issue for this week, which has just reached me today, there has begun thus early the leveling of taunts at those students who, for various reasons, do not intend to become members of the S. A. T. C. On the other hand, I have not observed the slightest indication in your columns that there is any dissent whatever from the policy of the college authorities in adopting military training into this Quaker institution. This letter is designed to remedy, in part, such defect in your reflection of college opinion.Personally, I have been delighted to ' welcome into my course on the Courses and Objects of the Great War the students who have been required by the Government to take a course on "War Aims." I have been giving this course yearly since 1915 and have done my best to elucidate and exemplify in it those principles of international government and conduct to which President Wilson has given such magnificent expression in recent public addresses, and which, together with internationalists in many lands, I have done my best to promote bv voice and pen ever since the first Hague Conference in 1899 brought them officially to the notice Ql_the world. It has been one of my cnief delights to receive from former students now in France letters expressing their enthusiastic devotion to the international government which is to prevent war and insure justice among the nations throughout the future. *lay there go out from Swarthmore and from every other college in our land an ever-increasing and finally victorious number of young men and women dedicated to this great construction task of pur time! As for military training in Swarthmore College, permit me to assure you that there are some of the managers, some of the faculty, some of the alumni and some of the students who wholly disapprove of it. One reason why we disapprove of it has been stated by the President and Board of Managers as late as May 20. 1918, in a published letter "To the Undergraduate Men of Swarthmore College," in the following words: "Though not strictly a sectarian institution, Swarthmore is a Friends' College, founded by that Society which, for more than 250 years, has consistently testified against war as a method of settling national or international disputes. Its campus, every building upon it. and quite three-fourths of its endowment of $2,000,000 have been contributed by those in sympathy with that testimony. In view of these facts, the Board feels that the introduction of a course in military training would constitute a brench of trust. It "further feels that it would be unwise now for this institution to depart from a fundamental principle of the Society, toward the acceptance of which the Board believes the thought of the civilized world is moving." Other, and perhaps even better, reasons for our disapproval than the above could readily be: stated; but I will not dwell upon them at this time and place. Very sincerely, WM. I. HULL. ."

tains, privates, every one of ability as news collectors and writers acting as reporters and subscription getters.' Everything that was* written he edited with the skill, the care and the fine sense with wMfch he had edited the manuscripts -df some of the foremost writers of the world. And then one day there came out of Richmond by auto truck, by wagon, by vehicles of every sort, a remarkably good newspaper—The Bayonet, which was the voice, the expression, the pride of 40,000 men in camp at Fort Lee. That first issue had a paid-up three months' subscription list of 36,000. In some companies there were more subscriptions than there were men, for various soldiers subscribed not only for themselves, but for the folks at home. There was between $4OO and $5OO profit in the first issue. There has been like profit in every issue. Advertising rates are 75 cents an inch. The commandant looked at that first issue and called the man of 40-odd to headquarters. "Lieutenant," he said, "I congratulate and thank you. You have given to the boys of this camp a newspaper of their own. It's a fine idea that every hit of revenue is to go to the division mess fund. It's a fine idea that the soldier shall have a soldier's paper. You have done well. You are relieved from all ordinary duties and may devote all your time henceforth to our paper." The man of 40-odd saluted and went back to his editorial desk. He had put out only two issues of The Bayonet, however, when orders came from Washington for him to proceed to Hoboken at once for special service. He turned The Bayonet over to another man and went to Hoboken and from there to France. In Paris he reported to General Pershing. The general instructed him as to the special service required of him and he went forth to obey. The other day a cablegram come from Paris to Washington asking that one of the greatest writers in America be instructed to prepare each week two thousand words of cable matter to be sent without fail and without delay to the second lieutenant in Paris. And so it is that the soldier in France, like the soldier in camp in America, has his own newspaper filled with just the sort of news he loves to read, with sporting stuff galore and news aplenty, all written, all prepared, all arranger, all presented by men of the highest talent. Did you ever hear of that newspaper in France? John Prshing wrote the salutatory. Every soldier in trench, in reserve, in hospital, in transport service, in engineer corps, in any and every department, gets a copy and treasures it. "What shall we call our paper?" asked Pershing of the man 40-odd. "The Stars and Stripes" was the answer. And the Sfa/s and Stripes it is. The editor? Second Lieutenant Guy T. Viskniskki, of No. 3733 Fourth avenue, New York, and of Montclair, N. J., ordinarily, but now of the Army of Freedom. Commerce and Finance, April 3. A Letter From Captain Viskniskki The staff of the paper now consists of seven officers and eight men, and it is being continually added to—Captain R. H. Waldo, late advertising manager of the New York Tribune, reported for duty this morning, and I have put him in charge of circulation, a difficult problem. Captain F. P. Adams' (late F. P. A., the column man of the New York Tribune), reported to me last week, and I have him writing a column and helping out otherwise. I am no longer copying cartoons from Life, etc., but have developed our own original cartoons, and so the paper is now entirely the product of the A. E. F., in which I include the newspaper correspondents with it, as they allow me to use what I want of their material and so are the paper's special men at the front. But I am using less of their stuff all the time as my staff increases and steadies, and it may be that before long the paper will have its own special representatives wherever American troops are in considerable numbers. That is my plan. I am working on it now, and if I get authority to carry it through, I will then be under no necessity to make use of correspondents' stories on any event whatever. The paper seems to be increasing in popularity if anything—already the mailing list (subscriptions paid by soldiers) to the States is nearing 3,000, and every day brings in at least a hundred names to be added thereto. The paper has now moved into offices of its own in the heart of Paris and in one of the finest office buildings in the city. We are now settled apparently for some time. You'd smile to see the equipment we have —not enough chairs and desks—-some of us work standing up; but we're getting out the paper and that's the main thing, after all. Some day, some time, we'll have the proper tools at hand; until then we do the best we can. But we're lots better off from today on than we were; until now we've had only one small room and some 15 men have stepped over one another doing their work. Oh, it's one great life getting out an army newspaper in France, but the paper seems to have found a place for itself In the army, and so it is all worth while, I know. I have here with me now two lieutenants, a second" lieutenant, seven enlisted men three field clerks, a Ford auto and driver,, and three orderlies and a captain are yet to come; and I've recommended a whole fleet of autos for distributing the paper properly throughout the army zone.

GOWDY Influenza Responsible for Death of Former Swarthmore Athlete An illness of no more than a week resulted in the death last Wednesday, October 8, of Lawrence P. Gowdy, 'l6, at his home in Brookline, Pa. The immediate cause was pneumonia, developing out of a severe attack of the Spanish influenza. Gowdy's death is particularly to be mourned because of its suddenness. Only two weeks ago Edwin Gowdy, a cousin, who is now a senior at Swarthmore, found Lawrence in excellent health upon a visit to his home. His wife, Lina Spencer, survived her husband by only a few days. Gowdy had been engaged in the offices of the Emergency Fleet Corporation at Hog Island, where the contagion of influenza was especially obnoxious. He is to be buried at his Connecticut home, wrhere live his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Willis Gowdy, Thompsonville. Conn. During his four years at Swarthmore Gowdy was a brilliant track athlete and a prominent member of the class of 'l6. THE PHOENIX, SWARTHMORE, PA.
