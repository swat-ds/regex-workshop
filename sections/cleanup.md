# Exercise 1: Data Cleanup

First we are going perform basic clean up tasks on a dataset because nobody ever has to cleanup any data ever.

What are common data cleanup tasks you've performed?

We will begin with NUFORC, which has been standardized by [@planetsig and made available here(https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports)].

[Open the salted Pennsylvania data subset](../data/ufo-pa-salted.csv) in Visual Studio Code.

How might we remove extra characters from the date field?

How might we fix common OCR errors in the description?
