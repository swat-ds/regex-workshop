# :key: Key Terms :key:

*Character* What is the smallest unit of text?

*Cybernetics* The science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things. (New Oxford American Dictionary) For further explorations [checkout the collaborative art/code/library project called the Cybernetics Library](https://cybernetics.social/).

*Data Structure* How we see a spreadsheet or a web page or a MARC record? How does our view change depending what program we are using? How might the computer see them?

*Finite state (automaton)* An abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs. ([So says Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine)).

*Serialization* What's the difference between data in memory and stored data? What's the difference between a binary and a text file?

*Sets* In mathematics, a set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. ([So says Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics))).

*String* This is probably the only actual **key** term. :woman_shrugging: And you probably already know the answer.
